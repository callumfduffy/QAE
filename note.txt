MAKE SURE TO LOG INTO PC 194, should not be needed in the conda env
DOES PC205 RUN PYTHON 3.11?
'if vscode server login is giving you grief', rm -rf .vscode-server/
screen -RD afk
screen -XS afk quit

maybe use tmux instead of screen, 
create a session: tmux new -s session1
detach from session: crtl^B D
re-attach to the session: tmux attach -t session1

do I need to know the pc i logged into before?
these were made on pc 205 (not sure how I remembered)

Things to run:
    - create and run dataset permutation example
    - run kl div permutation with rx feature map
    - use classical model used in paper see performance
    - change init params between folds see how it changes, probably need a new seed between runs
current sessions:
    - session1: entanglement_experiment on zzz latent size 2, new permute order
    - session2: entanglement_experiment on wg layers 2 latent size 2
    - session3: permutation_experiment on zzz 
    - session4: random_entanglement_experiment on ng layers 2 latent size 2
    - session5: random_entanglement_experiment on wg using AdamOptimizer (forgot to tmux)
    - session6: ansatz_experiment higgs inp6


for presentation:
    - contamination study, maybe introduce quantum tailored distributions 
    - engineer gaussian dataset
    - performance v param number
